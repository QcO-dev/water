# Water Programming Language

## What is it?

Water is a compiled programming language, targetting the JVM. It is intended to allow for less boilerplate code and easier development.


## Development of Water
Water is currently being developed by a single member team (me, myself, and I) so updates and bug fixes may take a while.
